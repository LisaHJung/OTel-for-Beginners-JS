# OpenTelemetry for Beginners - The JavaScript Journey

Getting started with OpenTelemetry can feel overwhelming, but this beginner series for JavaScript developers will guide you step by step.

First, we’ll answer the question: What is OpenTelemetry?

# Episode 1 - What is OpenTelemetry?
🎬 Watch this video to learn what OpenTelemetry is and why it matters.

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/iEEIabOha8U/0.jpg)]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRwVwCvLAg](https://youtu.be/iEEIabOha8U))

Now that you’ve covered the basics in Episode 1, let’s move on to Episode 2 to explore the architecture and objectives that will kickstart your trace pipeline.

# Episode 2 - Overview: Kickstart Your Trace Pipeline with OpenTelemetry
## Learning Environment Architecture
<img width="1906" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71773bfa-e488-4e8f-92fd-d36468827a75" />

## Objectives 
- Instrument a Node.js app using the Auto Instrumentation Module to generate traces and send them to the OpenTelemetry Collector.
- Configure the OpenTelemetry Collector to receive, process, and export traces to the Jaeger backend.
- Use the Jaeger UI to visualize and verify that the traces have been correctly processed.

**Note:**
- Docker runs the OTel Collector and Jaeger side by side with our app for easy setup and integration.

## Two project branches 
1. [`traces-barebones-setup`](https://github.com/LisaHJung/O4B/tree/original-setup)
- Instruments the Roll the Dice app and sends traces to the OpenTelemetry Collector.
- The Collector forwards traces to Jaeger for storage and visualization.
2. [`post-processing`](https://github.com/LisaHJung/O4B/tree/post-processing) 
- Uses the same setup as traces-barebones-setup, but applies processors to traces. 
- These processors enrich and clean up resource and attribute data, and batch traces for more efficient exporting.

#  Episode 3 - Set Up Your Learning Environment: Ready, Steady, Trace!

## Run the demo locally
**Before getting started, make sure you install:**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  
**Clone the project**
```
//directory of your choice
git clone https://github.com/LisaHJung/Getting-started-with-OTel-in-15-minutes.git
```
**Start the server**

Execute the following commands.
```
//in the project directory
npm install
npm start
```
**Verify the app is running**

In your browser, go to the following URL: http://localhost:8080/rolldice

Refresh the page multiple times. This app will generate a random number from 1-6 just as if you were rolling a die. 

![Roll the dice mov](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32f80dc2-93b0-4578-91db-17b316a79760)

**Using Docker, run the OTel Collector and Jaeger**
```
//project directory in a different terminal
docker compose up --build 
```
**Refresh the Roll the Dice app page multiple times to send traces to the OTel Collector**

Take a look at the terminal that is running Docker.

You will be able to see the logs of traces that are flowing through the Collector.

<img width="1040" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36081b69-8d28-4e16-9afa-86957759fc90" />

**Verify that the OTel Collector is sending traces to the Jaeger backend**
1. Go to the following URL (http://localhost:16686/) to access the Jaeger UI. 

2. Click on the "Service" section (orange box) to view all the services that are sending traces to Jaeger.

<img width="1920" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cfc0b94-990c-4e8f-9ebc-c58b73f850b2" />

In our set up, the service name was set to "demo". 

Select the service "demo" then click on the "Find Traces" button (blue arrow).

If you don't see the service name "demo", try refreshing the Roll the Dice app page multiple times, verify that the OTel Collector is receiving telemetry by checking the OTel Collector logs (terminal running Docker), and then refreshing the Jaeger UI page.

3. Click on one of the traces (orange box)
<img width="1920" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf2e0018-c332-4c92-9ebf-9e88f86d8f6b" />

4. Click on its root span (Get/rolldice span)
<img width="1919" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5e437b8-2cda-4760-93b6-0cc8dcbdba7b" />

5. Expand the `Tags` and `Process` sections to view the metadata about traces collected from the app
<img width="1920" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/826578a3-6f3c-4a33-acfb-f76997eeb9ff" />

**The `Tags` section shows details about what happened during a request.** 

<img width="1920" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/930107d9-08b2-417a-b41d-5a2d80e54cc8" />

It consists of `span attributes` (i.e. routes, method, errors)  to help you understand the behavior of your app.

**The `Process` section shows information about the app or service that created the trace.**

<img width="1920" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b17572ff-1ac3-4559-a997-e0ab1e382923" />

It consists of `resource attributes` that present info about the machine it ran on, and the command used to start it. 

It helps you see where the request came from and which service handled it.


# Episode 4 -  Automatic Instrumentation Module
- When should I use instrumentation
- Zewro code vs auto instrumentation
- Manual insetrumentation
- Custom  instrumentation 

# Episode 5 - Back to Basics: Bare Bones OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration

In our setup, the following OTel packages have been installed:  
```
npm install @opentelemetry/sdk-node \
  @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node \
  @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc
```
**instrumentation.js**

```
const opentelemetry = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-node');

const {
  getNodeAutoInstrumentations,
} = require('@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node');

const {
  OTLPTraceExporter,
} = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc');

const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter({
     url: 'http://localhost:4317', 
  }),
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
});

sdk.start();
```

`instrumentation.js` completes four tasks:

1. Import the required OTel packages needed for tracing:
```
const opentelemetry = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-node');
const { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node');
const { OTLPTraceExporter } = require('@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc');
```

2. Set up the tracing system within our app by creating a new instance of the NodeSDK:

```
const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  // configuration goes here
});
```

3. Configure the tracing system to automatically generate traces and export traces to the local OTel Collector:

```
const sdk = new opentelemetry.NodeSDK({
  traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter({
    url: 'http://localhost:4317',
  }),
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
});

```
4. Start the tracing system to begin recording traces and sending them to the Collector:
```
sdk.start();
```
**IMPORTANT**

- The instrumentation setup and configuration must run **before** your application code. 
  - One tool commonly used for this task is the –require flag.
- In a properly instrumented application, the servce name is set as an environment variable.
- To meet these requirements, we added the following app "start" script to `package.json`
  
**package.json**

```
{
  "name": "latest",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=demo node --require ./instrumentation.js app.js"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",   
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": "",
  "dependencies": {
    "@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node": "^0.60.1",
    "@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc": "^0.202.0",
    "@opentelemetry/sdk-node": "^0.202.0",
    "express": "^5.1.0"
  }
}
```
## OTel Collector configuration
**otel/otel-collector-config.yaml**
```
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

exporters:
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed

  otlp/jaeger:
    endpoint: jaeger:4317
    tls:
      insecure: true

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [debug, otlp/jaeger]
```
**Our OTel Collector configuration consists of 3 components:**
1. Receivers
2. Exporters
3. Service 

**`Receivers` tell the Collector how to receive telemetry data**
```
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

```
- We set up the OTLP receiver to accept incoming telemetry data on two ports so it can receive data from our app.
  

**`Exporters` send data out to OTLP-compliant backends of your choice.**
```
exporters:
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed

  otlp/jaeger:
    endpoint: jaeger:4317
    tls:
      insecure: true
```
- The `debug` exporter prints the telemetry data to the Collector’s logs in a detailed way.
  - It displays what data is flowing through the Collector and is useful for debugging or development. 
  
 <img width="1040" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36081b69-8d28-4e16-9afa-86957759fc90" />
 
- The `otlp/jaeger` exporter sends the telemetry data to the Jaeger backend at port 4317.


**The `Service` component configures how the data flows inside the Collector.**
```
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [debug, otlp/jaeger]
```
- Our configuration defines a pipeline for traces.
- The traces sent from the app is received by the `otlp` receiver.
- The `debug` exporter logs traces to the terminal where the Collector is running.
- The `otlp/jaeger` exporter forwards traces to Jaeger. 

<img width="1920" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf2e0018-c332-4c92-9ebf-9e88f86d8f6b" />


## Process traces using the OTel Collector 

**Switch to the [`post-processing`](https://github.com/LisaHJung/O4B/tree/post-processing) branch using your terminal.**
```
//in the directory of the project
git checkout post-processing
``` 
**Stop and restart the OTel Collector and Jaeger.**
```
//in the project directory
CTRL + C
docker compose up --build 
```
**Refresh the Roll the Dice app page multiple times to send the traces to the newly configured OTel Collector.**

<img width="1040" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36081b69-8d28-4e16-9afa-86957759fc90" />

**Using the Jaeger UI, examine the new traces to verify that they have been processed correctly.**

# Episode 6 - Processing Traces: OpenTelemtry Collector in Action

**Add 3 processors to the original OpenTelemetry Collector configuration.** 
- `resource` 
- `attributes` 
- `batch` 

**otel/otel-collector-config.yaml**
```
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

processors:
  resource:
    attributes:
      - key: deployment.environment.name
        value: local
        action: insert
      - key: host.arch
        action: delete
      - key: host.id
        action: delete
      - key: host.name
        action: delete  
      - key: process.command
        action: delete
      - key: process.command_args
        action: delete
      - key: process.executable.path
        action: delete
      - key: process.owner
        action: delete
      - key: process.pid
        action: delete

  attributes:
    actions:
      - key: http.user_agent
        action: delete
      - key: net.host.ip
        action: delete
      - key: net.peer.ip
        action: delete
      - key: net.host.port
        action: delete
      - key: net.peer.port
        action: delete

  batch:
    timeout: 5s
    send_batch_size: 512

exporters:
  debug:
    verbosity: detailed

  otlp/jaeger:
    endpoint: jaeger:4317
    tls:
      insecure: true

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [resource, attributes, batch]
      exporters: [debug, otlp/jaeger]
```
**Processors modify, filter, or enrich telemetry data within the Collector before the data gets exported**

**The `resource` processor modifies metadata about the service or host.**
```
processors:
  resource:
    attributes:
      - key: deployment.environment.name
        value: local
        action: insert
      - key: host.arch
        action: delete
      - key: host.id
        action: delete
      - key: host.name
        action: delete  
      - key: process.command
        action: delete
      - key: process.command_args
        action: delete
      - key: process.executable.path
        action: delete
      - key: process.owner
        action: delete
      - key: process.pid
        action: delete
```
- `deployment.environment.name` resource attributes was added to the incoming traces.

<img width="1916" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/836b9309-1d38-4826-8354-56be141de873" />

```
processors:
  resource:
    attributes:
      - key: deployment.environment.name
        value: local
        action: insert
      - key: host.arch
        action: delete
      - key: host.id
        action: delete
      - key: host.name
        action: delete  
      - key: process.command
        action: delete
      - key: process.command_args
        action: delete
      - key: process.executable.path
        action: delete
      - key: process.owner
        action: delete
      - key: process.pid
        action: delete
```
The following resource attributes were deleted to remove sensitive or irrelevant data.
This is done to reduce noise, improve privacy, and keep trace data focused.
  - host.arch
  - host.id
  - host.name
  - process.command
  - process.command_asrgs
  - process.executable.path
  - process.owner
  - process.pid

**Old traces from the original OTel Collector configuration:**
<img width="1905" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d54248b6-2dd8-4ff2-a4d5-515cdd8ad7fb" />

**New traces from the new OTel Collector configuration:**
<img width="1916" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0da2cef-e183-42d9-9520-4fb9b4b46f4b" />

**The `attributes` processor modifies, adds, or removes span attributes.**

```
attributes:
    actions:
      - key: http.user_agent
        action: delete
      - key: net.host.ip
        action: delete
      - key: net.host.port
        action: delete
      - key: net.peer.ip
        action: delete
      - key: net.peer.port
        action: delete
```

The following resource attributes were deleted to remove sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII). 
  - http.user_agent
  - net.peer.ip
  - net.host.port
  - net.peer.ip
  - net.peer.port

Deleting them enhances privacy and security compliance and reduces the size of trace payloads.  

**Old traces from the original OTel Collector configuration:**
<img width="1920" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c138b6d7-bce3-4691-b992-693a90bbeebe" />

**New traces from the new OTel Collector configuration:**
<img width="1920" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/485c084c-4144-4b24-895b-d6b27a228f18" />

**The `batch` processor groups telemetry data into batches before exporting.**
```
batch:
    timeout: 5s
    send_batch_size: 512

```
For best practice, add the `batch` processor to the Collector configuration to improve performance and reduce overhead. 

Adjust the parameters to serve your use case. 

**The Service component was updated to include the processors that have been added.**
```
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [resource, attributes, batch]
      exporters: [debug, otlp/jaeger]
```

**IMPORTANT**

In the `service` component, you must pay attention to the order in which the proccessors are listed as processors are applied sequentially!

The `batch` processor should be listed **last** to group the data into batches before exporting.
